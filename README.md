My first  attempt at machine learning, which complements the dataset creation project with Vinted. 
So I decided to do a test on colab with pokemon cards, because why not, and because I had friends who wanted a tool to measure the value of pokemon cards.

Main objectives

  Data extraction and organization
        Download map images and associated metadata from sources such as Kaggle.
        Organize data structure for efficient processing.

  Data pre-processing and sorting
        Set up a Python script to automatically sort and structure the data.
        Preparation of a subset of data (samples) for rapid testing.

  Technical approach
        Use of advanced libraries such as fastai for computer vision.
        Integration of tools to automate workflow, particularly for managing large files such as high-definition images.
